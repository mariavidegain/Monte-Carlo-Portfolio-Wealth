# Monte-Carlo-Portfolio-Wealth
This project simulates the performance of a simple portfolio composed of equity (SPY), bonds (IEF), and a small allocation to cash (3M T-Bill).  
The goal is to model possible future portfolio paths, and estimate basic risk metrics.

We start by downloading monthly price data for SPY and IEF from Yahoo Finance (2005â€“2025), and the 3M Treasury Bill rate from the FRED database.  
Monthly simple returns are calculated for each asset. The portfolio keeps fixed target weights of 60% equity, 35% bonds, and 5% cash, with monthly rebalancing.

We estimate monthly average returns and the covariance matrix from historical data.  
A Monte Carlo simulation then generates 10,000 different 10-year (120-month) paths, assuming returns follow a multivariate normal distribution. Each path represents a potential evolution of portfolio wealth over time, starting from an initial value of 1.

The simulation shows:
- 50 sample simulated portfolio paths  
- The terminal wealth distribution  
- The median maximum drawdown  
- The 1-year 95% Value-at-Risk (VaR)

### Assumptions
- Monthly returns are i.i.d. and jointly normal.  
- Portfolio is rebalanced monthly to maintain target weights.  
- The cash return is based on the 3M US Treasury Bill rate.  
- Returns are calculated as simple monthly percentages instead of log returns.  
- Transaction costs, taxes, and fees are excluded.

### Limitations
- Normality assumption ignores fat tails and extreme events.  
- Correlation and volatility are assumed constant over time.  
- Liquidity constraints and rebalancing costs are not considered.  
- Interest rate and inflation dynamics are not explicitly modelled.
